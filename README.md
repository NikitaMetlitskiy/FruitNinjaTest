# MyPetProjects
All my projects on SWIFT

I'm always looking for something new, seeking to advance and expand my capabilities.

I consider myself a team player. I value the experience of working in a team of professionals, who can collaborate effectively and share their bright ideas. My goal is to be useful and bring value to the company.

Hobbies: self-education, all kinds of sports, reading, spending time with friends, table-games.
